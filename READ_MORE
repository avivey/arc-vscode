Some more in-depth information about this extension.

Preview Remarkup feature
========================

It works by making a call to your Phorge server to render the Remarkup. So all
your objects, macros, custom Remarkup rules are available and used. It's also
a little slower then locally-rendered stuff like Markdown.

I made it because I sometimes like writing unnecessary long things[1], and
writing in the editor is easier then the built-in text editor of the browser.

CSS, Javascript and images rendered in Remarkup should not work - these are
assets downloaded from the internet and should be blocked by security policy.
Images do appear to work though.

The CSS for rendering, and the Fontawesome font are bundled in the extension.
The CSS was created by means of downloading the `core.pkg.css` and manually
removing things I thought are not used.
