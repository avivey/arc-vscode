TODO
====
- Some UI hint that arc-lint is running.

Long Term Desired Features
==========================
- Fancy UIs for
  - quick create task (arc todo)
  - arc unit (show results in vscode-native way, show code coverage)
  - arc paste (upload and download)
- list open Differential Revision in repo (for review)
  - Also arc-patch them
- get hovercard (content) for any object
- preview Remarkup (like the markdown preview, but by calling the server)
- some magic to help the External Editor Link
- arc lint: special-case some messages for better visibility (find more range/information.)
- arc lint: support auto-fix (apply diff)
- arc lint: `locations` field may be parsed into `relatedInformation`.


Features we Can have, but maybe we Shouldn't
============================================
- "recent activity" feed?
- UI to show server-side blame (`diffusion.blame`), probably only useful for svn or linux.git.
- push notifications from website?
